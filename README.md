Simple Grade Chooser & Plotter (R)

An intuitive R script that allows users to choose grades and view them on a plot using predefined (yet-to-be-provided) datasets. It’s perfect as a quick demonstration of conditional logic and basic plotting in R.

Project Status

R code file is available (Simple_Grade_Calculation.R)

The pre-defined data files (e.g., .csv, .txt) required by the script are not uploaded yet

The project is nearing completion—just waiting to finalize by adding the data files

What It Does

Prompts the user to select or input grades based on predefined categories

Uses those grades to generate a visual plot (e.g., bar chart or line graph)

Helps practice R scripting with data input handling and data visualization

Tech Stack & Key Concepts

Language: R

Core Concepts:

Conditional logic for grade selection

Basic plotting (likely using plot(), histograms, or bar charts)

Console interaction (user input via readline() or similar)

Modular structure within a single script

How to Use (Once Data Is Uploaded)
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Sanjay28082007/Simple-Grade-Plot.git
cd Simple-Grade-Plot

# Open and run the R script in your R environment or RStudio
# For example, in RStudio:
# - Open Simple_Grade_Calculation.R
# - Source or run the script


Currently, since the supporting data files are missing, running the script may result in errors. Data files will be added soon to enable full functionality.

Roadmap / Next Steps

 Upload the pre-described data files (e.g., grades.csv, grade_labels.txt)

 Confirm the script reads the correct files (path and naming consistency)

 Optionally enhance the plot using ggplot2 for polished visuals

 Add comments and help prompts within the script for better clarity

 Save output plots to file (e.g., .png, .pdf) for sharing

 (Optional) Add interactivity via R Shiny for live grade selection and plotting
